# Voice Is All You Need
This project is built for ETH Global Bangkok



Our project is an AI agent that enables voice-based blockchain transactions. Simply interact with the agent using your voice to complete secure on-chain transfers. The process is smooth yet highly secure thanks to voiceprint signatures and on-chain key voice recording snippets. To protect sensitive info and prevent direct exposure of voiceprints, users can make limited edits (e.g., masking or tuning) to the voice before itâ€™s recorded on-chain. We also use ZKPs to provide proof of editing. 



Our project leverages several key technologies to bring voice-based blockchain transactions to life:
1. AI Agent: Built with the Hyperbolic Inference API, our agent analyzes conversational context to extract transaction-related details efficiently.
2. Blockchain Integration: Transactions are executed on Ethereum and L2 chains using their SDKs and APIs, ensuring fast and reliable on-chain interactions.
3. Voiceprint Signatures: A GMM model trains user-specific voiceprint recognition, verifying the speaker matches the wallet owner. The inference process is secured using ZKML(EZKL) to prevent inference result from being tempered.
4. Proof of Editing: We custom-designed zero-knowledge circuits using Plonky2 to validate limited edits (masking or tuning) on voice data. This ensures sensitive information remains private while proving the integrity of edits.
5. ENS Service: ENS is integrated to resolve wallet addresses, improving user experience by avoiding cumbersome verbal address exchanges. 
6. Onchain Data Storage: Large audio data and ZKPs are stored and accessed via decentralized storage solutions like Filecoin's Storacha, ensuring scalability and performance.
